## Task Description :
Create an API that takes data from the user and store it into a database.

<br>

### Python Code :

- I've used Flask here to take data from an HTML form. I've tried to use JSON but couldn't finish the code. Then I've found Flask has an request object that can be used to get data from a form. "

- Then I tried to connect the Flask app to SQL Server. I couldn't get it done. One of my friend from varsity helped me use **pyodbc** to connect the app to a database. For some reasons, it just wouldn't connect. We tried almost everything. Nothing worked in the end.
